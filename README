# Real-time Location Tracking Application

This project is a real-time location tracking application that uses Node.js, Express, Socket.io, and Leaflet.js. The application allows users to share their geolocation data in real-time, displaying each user's location on a map.

## Features

- Real-time location sharing
- Real-time location updates on the map
- User disconnection handling and marker removal

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express.js
- Socket.io
- Leaflet.js
- EJS (Embedded JavaScript)

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v12 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Abhishekkumar60818/real-time-location-tracking.git
    cd real-time-location-tracking
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Running the Application

1. Start the server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

2. Open your web browser and go to:
    ```
    http://localhost:3000
    ```

## Code Structure

- `app.js`: Server-side code that sets up the Express server and handles Socket.io connections.
- `public/`: Contains client-side code.
  - `script.js`: Client-side JavaScript that handles geolocation and real-time updates using Socket.io and Leaflet.js.
- `views/`: Contains EJS templates.
  - `index.ejs`: Main template rendered by the server.

## How It Works

1. **Client-Side**:
   - The client uses the Geolocation API to get the user's current position.
   - It sends the latitude and longitude to the server via Socket.io.
   - The client also listens for location updates from other users and updates the map accordingly.

2. **Server-Side**:
   - The server listens for incoming connections and location data.
   - It broadcasts the location data to all connected clients.
   - When a user disconnects, the server notifies the remaining clients to remove the user's marker from the map.
